## U3: A Unified Universally Unique Identifer for rock climbing routes

U3 is a proposed open standard for creating a unique identifer for rock climbing routes.

## The Problem

- Currently rock climbing routes are cataloged independently by many crowd-sourcing platforms, OpenBeta, theCrag, MountainProject, 27 Crags...
- Each platform maintains their own unique identifer for the same climbing route or the boulder problem.
- Matching and cross-referencing the same climbs between platforms are difficult without a centralized registry or lookup tables.

## Proposal

Let's define a unique ID generation scheme that allows everyone to **independently** generate a **globally unique** and **consistent** ID for each climb.
